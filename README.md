## Setup:

### Clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:guilherme-andrade/recruitr.git
cd recruitr
```

<br>

### Install all dependencies:

```
bundle install
yarn install
```

<br>

### Setup the Database

```
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```
> üìù *The seeds replicate pretty much the whole application logic, so `db/seeds.rb` is a good basis to understand the app.*

<br>

### Run the application

```
foreman start
```
> üìù *Foreman uses a simple Procfile configuration to start all required runtime processes, apart from the postgres database.*

## Authentication:

Since I went for a full-stack Rails approach, I used a simple devise authentication scheme, with little to no modification. In the case the application was a simple API, I would've kept the authentication to a minimal JWT approach.

<br>

### To log in

```
email: fake_hr@gmail.com
password: 123456
```

## The Views:

In this application the following libraries were used on top of ActionView:

- `ViewComponent` - much like any other presenter, decorator library.
- `StimulusJS` - Basecamp's lightweight JS framework
- `StimulusReflex` - a rapidly growing Rails library based on Phoenix's Live View built on top of Morphdom, Stimulus and CableReady.
- `ViewComponentReflex` - a library to add StimulusReflex to ViewComponents.
- `Bootstrap 5` - for styles

These 4 libraries in conjunction make it so that the usual Rails views are better organized, and faster than a virtual DOM, at a fraction of the effort.

<br>

## The Back End:

Here I used:

- `Interactor` - an improved service-like abstraction
- `GoogleApiClient` - to access google calendar

## Demo

You can see find video demo [here](https://www.loom.com/share/01707ae7a99942979a006280f91c2cba).

The views are based on the screenshots from the project description and allow a user to:

- Login/Register.
- View all Job Offers.
- Create a new Job Offer.
- View a Job Offer and all its applications.
- Add existing or new applicants to a job offer.
- View a candidate and all its applications.
- Create appointments between recruiters and applicants regarding a specific job offer.
- Send Calendar invites to both the Recruiter and Applicant.

In the last point, I adapted the logic slightly, by automatically selecting the **available recruiter** that has the **most skills** in common with the Job Offer.

This logic is present in the [`OrganizeAppointment`](https://github.com/guilherme-andrade/recruitr/blob/master/app/interactors/organize_appointment.rb) organizer and it's organizers.
